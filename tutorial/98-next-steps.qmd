# Next Steps {#sec-next-steps}

-   Use different formulations for the cost function (relative costs, total costs)

-   Getting different results when using different starting values for the optimization of traits

-   Implement another optimization algorithm and compare performances

-   Try to implement the cost for Jmax as well

    -   Note: This could become tricky because of it having too little

-   Sketch an algorithm to account for an instantaneous energy balance model

-   Potential Test Casta

    -   Lin et al data
    -
